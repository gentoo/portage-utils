installed: |
    Instead of listing the contents of a package, just print the package
    name if the package is currently installed.
binpkgs: |
    Operate on binary packages instead of installed packges.
tree: |
    Used with \fB\-I\fR to list packages available in the tree.
umap: |
    List USE-flags enabled when the package was installed.  This flag
    implies \fB\-I\fR.
slots: |
    Display installed packages with slots (use twice for subslots).
    This flag implies \fB\-I\fR.
repo: |
    Display installed packages with repository the ebuild originated from.
    This flag implies \fB\-I\fR.
columns: |
    Like \fB\-Iv\fR, but package name and version are separated by a
    space for easy consumption by e.g.\ shell scripts which can read
    space-separated columns.
masks: |
    Filter matches for packages that are masked via the profiles.  In
    particular useful in combination with \fB\-Itv\fR to find the latest
    available version of a given package.
verbose: |
    When used with \fB\-I\fR, print the package version next to name.
    When listing the package contents, \fB\-v\fR displays symlinks with
    an arrow (\->) to their target.  Shows disabled USE-flags when used
    with \fB\-U\fR.
format: |
    Print matched atom using given format string.

    The default base format is:
      \fI%[CATEGORY]%[PN]\fR
    .br
    If \fB-v\fR|\fB--verbose\fR the base format is instead:
      \fI%[CATEGORY]%[PF]\fR
    .br

    If \fB-k\fR|\fB--binpkgs\fR is set:
      \fI%[BUILDID]\fR is appended
    .br
    If \fB-S\fR|\fB--slots\fR is set once:
      \fI%[SLOT]\fR is appended
    .br
    If \fB-S\fR|\fB--slots\fR is set twice:
      \fI%[SUBSLOT]\fR is appended
    .br
    If \fB-R\fR|\fB--repo\fR is set:
      \fI%[REPO]\fR is appended
    .br

    Note that this only sets the format of the atom field, not the entire output line.

    For more information see \fBqatom\fR(1).
