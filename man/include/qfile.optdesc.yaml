verbose: |
    Print package versions and symlink targets for matches, warn about
    problems with resolving symlinks or positioning packages under an
    alternative root.
quiet: |
    Don't print matching file for matches, just the package.  Don't
    report about orphan files.
dir: |
    Only consider basename of argument and also match directories, this
    option makes qlist ignore any path component given in the arguments
    if present.
follow: |
    Follow symlinks in both input as well as VDB stored entries.  This
    is useful in situations such as usr-merge where files are stored in
    locations which contain a symlink traversal, e.g. /bin/bash.  By
    default only the input arguments are resolved to make an exact match
    with the VDB.  Turning this option on may affect performance.
format: |
    Print matched atom using given format string.
    The default is \fI%[CATEGORY]%[PN]\fR or \fI%[CATEGORY]%[PF]\fR in
    verbose mode (\fB-v\fR|\fB--verbose\fR).
    If \fB-S\fR|\fB--slot\fR is set, \fI%[SLOT]\fR will be appended.
    Note that this only sets the format of the atom field, not the
    entire output line.
    For more information see \fBqatom\fR(1).
