date: |
    Limit the selection of packages to the date given, or to the range
    of dates if this argument is given twice.  The \fB--date\fR option
    can take a few forms.
    .RS
    .IP "NUMBER <day|week|month|year>[s] [ago]"
    Relative time, specifying \fINUMBER\fR \fIdays\fR, \fIweeks\fR,
    \fImonths\fR or \fIyears\fR, for example \fI3 days ago\fR.
    .IP today
    Alias for \fI0 days ago\fR.
    .IP yesterday
    Alias for \fI1 day ago\fR.
    .IP YYYY-MM-DD
    Big-endian date, with components separated by hyphens, starting with
    year, followed by month and day of month.
    .IP YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss
    As before, but hours, minutes and seconds added.  This is the same
    format qlop prints for timestamps.
    .IP "SSSSSSSSS or @SSSSSSSSS"
    Seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 (UTC), the UNIX epoch.
    .IP FORMAT|DATE
    Use \fIFORMAT\fR as input for \fBstrptime\fR(3) to parse \fIDATE\fR.
    .RE
lastmerge: |
    Limit selection to last Portage emerge action.  This option is a
    dynamic version of \fB-d\fR, and hence both cannot be used together.
time: |
    Show the time it took to merge, unmerge or sync.
average: |
    Calculate average merge, unmerge or sync time.  This is the average
    time for all occurrences found respecting any date limits.
summary: |
    Show a grand total for averages.  This option implies \fB-a\fR.
    Useful to compute time it takes to recompile all packages or a set
    of packages (e.g\. world).
human: |
    Print elapssed time in human readable format.  This form uses
    minutes, hours and days instead of just seconds.
current: |
    Show current emerging packages.  This relies on
    .I FEATURES=sandbox
    in order to detect running merges.
verbose: |
    Print package versions and revisions (PF) instead of package (PN).
quiet:
    Omit printing of timestamps and operation symbols, can be used to
    generate a flat list of atoms, e.g.\ \fB-qml\fR to print the package
    names merged in the last emerge operation.
running: |
    Print operations currently in progress.  An ETA is calculated based
    on the average for the operation.  If the elapsed exceeds the
    average, the ETA is calculated against the longest time observed for
    the operation.  The \fB-v\fR flag will display which mode is
    currently used.  If the elapsed time also exceeds the longest time
    observed, or no previous occurrences for the operation exist,
    \fIunknown\fR is printed.  When combined with \fB-t\fR the
    elapsed time is also displayed.
emerge: |
    Immitate \fBemerge\fR(1) output, as if \fBemerge -pv\fR had been
    run.  This produces a list of packages that were installed (N),
    upgraded (U), downgraded (UD), re-installed (R) or unmerged (D).
    The list always includes the version numbers, and for up/downgrades
    the previous version is listed between square brackets after the
    package.  When \fB-v\fR is used, the \fBemerge\fR invocations are
    printed as well, to really show what happened.  When concurrent
    merges are present in the displayed timeframe, the output will be
    hard to read.  This is a limitation of the \fIemerge.log\fR format.
    It is possible to combine this flag with the \fB-d\fR flag, in which
    case the default behaviour of displaying the last merge (\fB-l\fR)
    is disabled.
format: |
    Print matched atom using given format string.
    The default is \fI%[CATEGORY]%[PN]\fR or \fI%[CATEGORY]%[PF]\fR in
    verbose mode (\fB-v\fR|\fB--verbose\fR).
    Note that this only sets the format of the atom field, not the entire output line.
    For more information see \fBqatom\fR(1).
