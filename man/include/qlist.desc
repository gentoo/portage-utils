\fIqlist\fR shows the contents, or a subset thereof, of an installed
package.  Alternatively, lists whether a package is installed,
optionally with version, USE-flag, SLOT or REPO information.  The
\fIpkgname\fR to query for does not have to be an exact match, it may be
part of it, e.g.\ an entire category, or any package with some string in
its name.
