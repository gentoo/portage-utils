jobserver: |
    Start Make jobserver for the given amount of jobs.  The invocation
    will create a fifo in the filesystem and spawn a daemon process that
    opens a reader and writer on the fifo.  The amount of jobs are
    seeded in the fifo ready for Make to consume and return.
    Running this when another instance of the jobserver is already
    running returns the fifo for the running process.  Running with an
    argument of 0 jobs will stop an existing jobserver.
    Upon termination of the jobserver, the fifo is cleaned up and
    removed from the filesystem.
    It is adviced to use an alternative jobserver for global usage when
    the situation allows, such as e.g. \fIsteve\fR.  This mode is
    provided for scenarios where privilege restrictions apply, such as
    on Gentoo Prefix systems.  The canonical path for the fifo is under
    /tmp/.q-jobserver.sock for the configured Prefix offset (EPREFIX).
    This fifo can be used in e.g. MAKEFLAGS with
    --jobserver-auth=fifo:/tmp/.q-jobserver.sock.
overlays: |
    Print available overlays (read from repos.conf).  Use \fI-v\fR to
    see the source (file) where the overlay was declared.
envvar: |
    Print used environment variables and found values.  Use \fI-v\fR to
    see the source (file, environment) where the variable was declared.
    Additional arguments are treated as variable names to print the
    values for.  If just one name is given, only the value is printed if
    matched.  When no arguments or more than one argument is given, the
    variable name and the value is printed as a shell-style declaration.
masks: |
    Print the masks from package.mask files found.  Use \fI-v\fR to see
    the source (file) where the mask was declared.  Use multiple
    \fI-v\fR to print the comment right before the mask.  Additional
    arguments are treated as atom selectors which must match the masks.
