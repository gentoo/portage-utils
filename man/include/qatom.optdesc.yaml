    Specify a custom  output  format.  The default format is
    .nf
    %{CATEGORY} %{PN} %{PV} %[PR] %[SLOT] %[pfx] %[sfx]
    .fi
    Conversion specifiers start with a \fI%\fR symbol and are followed
    by either \fI{\fR or \fI[\fR.  Next is the name of the field to
    expand, followed by a matching \fI}\fR or \fI]\fR.  The difference
    between \fI{\fR and \fI[\fR is that the latter is only printed if
    the field referred is set, while the former prints \fI<unset>\fR in
    that case.

    The following fields are supported, which are inline with the
    variables from \fBebuild\fR(5).
    .RS
    .IP CATEGORY
    The category of the package.
    If this field is specified as \fI%[CATEGORY]\fR and it precedes a subsequent
    field start symbol, the field will be suffixed with a \fI/\fR.
    .IP P
    The package name and version without the ebuild revision.
    .IP PN
    The package name.
    .IP PV
    The package version without the ebuild revision.
    .IP PVR
    The package version including ebuild revision, which is also printed
    when zero, unlike for \fIPF\fR.
    .IP PF
    The package name, version and revision when not zero.  Thus, a zero
    revision \fI\-r0\fR is not printed.
    .IP PR
    The ebuild revision, when force printed, outputs \fI\-r0\fR when unset.
    .IP SLOT
    The package slot, when force printed, outputs \fI\-\fR when unset.
    .IP REPO
    The package repository.
    .IP pfx
    The package prefixes, that is version specifiers.
    .IP sfx
    The package suffices, currently that is just the asterisk.
    .RE
verbose: Force all expansions, basically treat all \fI[\fR like \fI{\fR.
quiet: Ignored for compatibility with other qapplets.
nocolor: Ignored for compatibility with other qapplets.
