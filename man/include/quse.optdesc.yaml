exact: Search for exact string, e.g.\ do not use regular expression matching.
verbose: |
    Show versions for packages that match the search.
    Also shows problems encountered during parsing.  These are mostly
    diagnostic and indicate possible incorrectness in the results.
quiet: Ignored for compatibility with other qapplets.
describe: |
    Describe the USE flag, when no USE-flag given and combined with
    \fB-p\fR, lists all USE-flags with their descriptions (and enabled
    state prefixed with an asterisk when used with \fB-I\fR) per
    package.
format: |
    Print matched atom using given format string.
    The default is \fI%[CATEGORY]%[PN]\fR or \fI%[CATEGORY]%[PF]\fR in
    verbose mode (\fB-v\fR|\fB--verbose\fR).
    If \fB-R\fR|\fB--repo\fR is set, \fI%[REPO]\fR will be appended.
    Note that this only sets the format of the atom field, not the entire output line.
    For more information see \fBqatom\fR(1).
