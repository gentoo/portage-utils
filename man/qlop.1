.SH NAME
qlop \- emerge log analyzer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B qlop
\fI[opts] <pkgname>\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I qlop
reads from $EMERGE_LOG_DIR/emerge.log and tries to extract
information about merges, unmerges and syncs.  It can
calculate average merge times or just list them.  When given no
arguments or just \fB-v\fR, \fIqlop\fR acts as if \fB-slumt\fR was given
and thus lists the time taken for all occurrances of merges, unmerges
and sync operations found in the log for the last \fBemerge\fR(1) action
performed by Portage.
.P
By default, packages are printed as CATEGORY/PN.  Use \fB-v\fR to print
the package version and revision numbers, e.g\. CATEGORY/PF.  Note that
when using this option, averages (\fB-a\fR) are reported per version
instead of per package.
.P
The non-option arguments to \fIqlop\fR can be any valid atoms.  Multiple
can be given to match.  Since all of these are treated as atoms, version
specifications can be used such as \fB<bash-5\fR.  This allows to zoom
in further on specific packages.
.P
After version \fB0.74\fR of portage-utils, \fIqlop\fR was changed
considerably to be more consistent and more advanced.  Most notably,
this has changed default date output and command line flags.  Instead
of reporting the time the operation finished, \fIqlop\fR now reports the
time the operation started.  The behaviour of the old \fB-g\fR flag is
best matched by the new \fB-t\fR flag.  Similar, the old \fB-t\fR flag
is matched by the new \fB-a\fR flag.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-summary\fR
Show a grand total for averages.  This option implies \fB-a\fR.
Useful to compute time it takes to recompile all packages or a set
of packages (e.g\. world).
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-time\fR
Show the time it took to merge, unmerge or sync.
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-average\fR
Calculate average merge, unmerge or sync time.  This is the average
time for all occurrences found respecting any date limits.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-predict\fR
Print prediction of time it takes to complete action.
.TP
\fB\-H\fR, \fB\-\-human\fR
Print elapssed time in human readable format.  This form uses
minutes, hours and days instead of just seconds.
.TP
\fB\-M\fR, \fB\-\-machine\fR
Print start/elapsed time as seconds with no formatting.
.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-merge\fR
Show merge history.
.TP
\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-unmerge\fR
Show unmerge history.
.TP
\fB\-U\fR, \fB\-\-autoclean\fR
Show autoclean unmerge history.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-sync\fR
Show sync history.
.TP
\fB\-E\fR, \fB\-\-emerge\fR
Immitate \fBemerge\fR(1) output, as if \fBemerge -pv\fR had been
run.  This produces a list of packages that were installed (N),
upgraded (U), downgraded (UD), re-installed (R) or unmerged (D).
The list always includes the version numbers, and for up/downgrades
the previous version is listed between square brackets after the
package.  When \fB-v\fR is used, the \fBemerge\fR invocations are
printed as well, to really show what happened.  When concurrent
merges are present in the displayed timeframe, the output will be
hard to read.  This is a limitation of the \fIemerge.log\fR format.
It is possible to combine this flag with the \fB-d\fR flag, in which
case the default behaviour of displaying the last merge (\fB-l\fR)
is disabled.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-endtime\fR
Report time at which the operation finished (iso started).
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-running\fR
Print operations currently in progress.  An ETA is calculated based
on the average for the operation.  If the elapsed exceeds the
average, the ETA is calculated against the longest time observed for
the operation.  The \fB-v\fR flag will display which mode is
currently used.  If the elapsed time also exceeds the longest time
observed, or no previous occurrences for the operation exist,
\fIunknown\fR is printed.  When combined with \fB-t\fR the
elapsed time is also displayed.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR \fI<arg>\fR, \fB\-\-date\fR \fI<arg>\fR
Limit the selection of packages to the date given, or to the range
of dates if this argument is given twice.  The \fB--date\fR option
can take a few forms.
.RS
.IP "NUMBER <day|week|month|year>[s] [ago]"
Relative time, specifying \fINUMBER\fR \fIdays\fR, \fIweeks\fR,
\fImonths\fR or \fIyears\fR, for example \fI3 days ago\fR.
.IP today
Alias for \fI0 days ago\fR.
.IP yesterday
Alias for \fI1 day ago\fR.
.IP YYYY-MM-DD
Big-endian date, with components separated by hyphens, starting with
year, followed by month and day of month.
.IP YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss
As before, but hours, minutes and seconds added.  This is the same
format qlop prints for timestamps.
.IP "SSSSSSSSS or @SSSSSSSSS"
Seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 (UTC), the UNIX epoch.
.IP FORMAT|DATE
Use \fIFORMAT\fR as input for \fBstrptime\fR(3) to parse \fIDATE\fR.
.RE
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-lastmerge\fR
Limit selection to last Portage emerge action.  This option is a
dynamic version of \fB-d\fR, and hence both cannot be used together.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR \fI<arg>\fR, \fB\-\-logfile\fR \fI<arg>\fR
Read emerge logfile instead of $EMERGE_LOG_DIR/emerge.log.
.TP
\fB\-w\fR \fI<arg>\fR, \fB\-\-atoms\fR \fI<arg>\fR
Read package atoms to report from file.
.TP
\fB\-F\fR \fI<arg>\fR, \fB\-\-format\fR \fI<arg>\fR
Print matched atom using given format string.
.TP
\fB\-\-root\fR \fI<arg>\fR
Set the ROOT env var.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Print package versions and revisions (PF) instead of package (PN).
.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
Omit printing of timestamps and operation symbols, can be used to generate a flat list of atoms, e.g.\ \fB-qml\fR to print the package names merged in the last emerge operation.
.TP
\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-nocolor\fR
Don't output color.
.TP
\fB\-\-color\fR
Force color in output.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Print this help and exit.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Print version and exit.
