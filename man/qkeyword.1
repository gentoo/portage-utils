.SH NAME
qkeyword \- list packages based on keywords
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B qkeyword
\fI[opts] <action> <args>\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIqkeyword\fR allows various searches based on KEYWORDS.  Some uses are
aimed at Gentoo developers, to allow querying which packages would be
available, or are candidate for keywording.
.P
By default, the entire tree is traversed.  Since this process can be
slow, or result in too many results, the match arguments can be used to
reduce the set of packages evaluated.  \fB-p\fR and \fB-c\fR match
package name and category respectively.  They can both be used at the
same time, but \fB-p\fR accepts regular atom format, including version
and/or range.  Hence, \fB-p\fR can be used to set both category as well
as package in one go.  The \fB-m\fR maintainer match, while reducing the
resulting set, is likely to slow down the query processing since the
metadata.xml file has to be read for each package examined.  It is best
used in combination with \fB-p\fR or \fB-c\fR.
.P
\fIqkeyword\fR uses the keyword found in the configured profile (ARCH)
for its queries.  This keyword can be overridden by giving the desired
keyword as argument.  Note that this does not change the profile in use,
which most notably can result in incorrect masks being applied for the
\fB-T\fR and \fB-S\fR options.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-p\fR \fI<arg>\fR, \fB\-\-matchpkg\fR \fI<arg>\fR
match pkgname.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR \fI<arg>\fR, \fB\-\-matchcat\fR \fI<arg>\fR
match catname.
.TP
\fB\-m\fR \fI<arg>\fR, \fB\-\-matchmaint\fR \fI<arg>\fR
match maintainer email from metadata.xml (slow).
.TP
\fB\-A\fR, \fB\-\-showarch\fR
show selected arch from profile configuration.
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-imlate\fR
list packages that can be marked stable for <arch>.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-dropped\fR
list packages that have dropped keywords for <arch>.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-needsstable\fR
list packages that have ~arch versions, but no stable versions for <arch>.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-stats\fR
display statistics about the portage tree.
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-all\fR
list packages that have at least one version keyworded for <arch>.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-not\fR
list packages that aren't keyworded for <arch>.
.TP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-stable\fR
list latest stable version per package for <arch>.
.TP
\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-testing\fR
list latest testing version per package for <arch>.
.TP
\fB\-F\fR \fI<arg>\fR, \fB\-\-format\fR \fI<arg>\fR
Print matched atom using given format string.
The default is \fI%[CATEGORY]%[PF]\fR.
Note that this only sets the format of the atom field, not the
entire output line.
For more information see \fBqatom\fR(1).
.TP
\fB\-\-root\fR \fI<arg>\fR
Set the ROOT env var.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Report full package versions, emit more elaborate output.
.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
Tighter output; suppress warnings.
.TP
\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-nocolor\fR
Don't output color.
.TP
\fB\-\-color\fR
Force color in output.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Print this help and exit.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Print version and exit.
.SH "RETRIEVING LATEST TESTING VERSION AVAILABLE"
.PP
To retrieve the latest available version in the ebuild tree marked as
testing for the given ARCH, can be done with a combination of flags,
mostly to restrict the search.  For instance, to find the latest version
of \fIsys-devel/gcc\fR available, one could use:
.nf
$ qkeyword -p sys-devel/gcc -T
sys-devel/gcc-8.3.0
.fi
It may be that there is a newer version available, but masked for the
configured profile (via package.mask).  Using \fB-v\fR will inform about
this scenario happening:
.nf
$ qkeyword -p dev-vcs/cvs -Tv
masked by =dev-vcs/cvs-1.12.12*: dev-vcs/cvs-1.12.12-r12
.fi
Unrelated, but to locate the mask given, use verbose mode on \fIq\fR's
mask listing:
.nf
$ q -mv dev-vcs/cvs
=dev-vcs/cvs-1.12.12* [/repo/gentoo/profiles/prefix/sunos/solaris/package.mask]
