- Adding applets is easy using the q framework.
  Note: Please try to keep applet names under 8 chars.
	* cp template.c qmyapplet.c (all applets use the prefix of the letter 'q') 
	* applets.h: add your prototype (see DECLARE_APPLET macro)
	* applets.h: add a new line to applets[] following the existing syntax
	* run `make depend` to auto regenerate dependent files

When and where you can please try to use an existing applet and extend 
on its functionality by adding more options vs adding a bunch of new 
little applets.

- Keep behavior consistent
	* matching:
		default is sloppy match
		-e exact match
		-r regex match

## Examples:
	* find elf files linking to old openssl
	qlist -ao | scanelf -BqgN libssl.so.0.9.6 -f -

	* print a package.use
	qlist -UCq | grep ' ' > package.use

	* find orphan files not owned by and package in /lib and /usr/lib
	qfile -o {,/usr}/lib/*
	
	# get PORTDIR
	DEBUG=: ./q -Ch 2>&1 | grep ^PORTDIR | awk '{print $3}

	# Verify all packages
	qcheck -a
