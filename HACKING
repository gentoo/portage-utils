- Adding applets is easy using the q framework.
  Note: Please try to keep applet names under 8 chars.
	* cp template.c qmyapplet.c (all applets use the prefix of the letter 'q') 
	* applets.h: add your prototype (see DECLARE_APPLET macro)
	* applets.h: add a new line to applets[] following the existing syntax
	* run `make depend` to auto regenerate dependent files

When and where you can please try to use an existing applet and extend 
on its functionality by adding more options vs adding a bunch of new 
little applets.

# Examples:
 qlist -ao | scanelf -BqgN libssl.so.0.9.6 -f -


- Keep behavior consistent
	* matching:
		default is sloppy match
		-e exact match
		-r regex match
